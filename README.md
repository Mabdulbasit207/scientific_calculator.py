🧠 Code Overview

Calculator class contains methods for each arithmetic operation.

inp_usage() function collects numeric input from the user.

The program uses conditional statements to execute the selected operation.

⚠️ Notes

The program does not currently handle invalid input (e.g., division by zero or invalid operators).

Input values are converted to float.

🌱 Future Improvements

Add error handling

Add input validation

Improve UI/UX

Support more operations
